# ConstructionSiteDBMSProject

Please switch over to the master branch to see the source code.

This is a construction site database management system developed as part of the final mini project of the DBMS course (UE20CS301) of PES University.

It was developed with MYSQL, Python and hosted by Streamlit.

Consists of 6 separate pages including a landing page that gives a basic overview of the entire project.

The Tables in the database are as follows: 
1)Construction Site
2)Architect
3)Budget
4)Labourer
5)Contractor

CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations are supported on all tables.

The final page, called command, allows a user to type in any query to access data directly onto the frontend.

Extensive use of triggers, procedures and functions have been made.
